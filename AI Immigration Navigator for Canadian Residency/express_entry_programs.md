# Canadian Immigration Programs Research

## Express Entry System

Express Entry is an online system that the Canadian government uses to manage immigration applications from skilled workers. It was introduced in January 2015 and is the main pathway for skilled workers to obtain permanent residency in Canada.

### Programs Managed Through Express Entry

There are three main immigration programs managed through Express Entry:

1. **Canadian Experience Class (CEC)**
   - For skilled workers with eligible Canadian work experience
   - Requires at least 1 year of skilled work experience in Canada within the last 3 years
   - Language requirements: CLB 7 for TEER 0 or TEER 1 occupations, CLB 5 for TEER 2 or TEER 3 occupations
   - No education requirement, but points are awarded for education in the CRS

2. **Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)**
   - For skilled workers with foreign work experience
   - Requires at least 1 year of continuous skilled work experience within the last 10 years
   - Language requirements: minimum CLB 7 across all abilities
   - Requires secondary education at minimum
   - Work experience must be in NOC TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3 categories

3. **Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP)**
   - For skilled workers who are qualified in a skilled trade
   - Requires at least 2 years of work experience in a skilled trade within the last 5 years
   - Language requirements: minimum CLB 5 for speaking and listening, CLB 4 for reading and writing
   - Requires either a valid job offer for at least 1 year or a certificate of qualification in the trade
   - No education requirement, but points are awarded for education in the CRS

### Provincial Nominee Program (PNP)

In addition to the three main programs, candidates can also apply through Express Entry for the Provincial Nominee Program:

- Provinces and territories can nominate candidates who meet their specific labor market needs
- A provincial nomination adds 600 points to a candidate's CRS score, virtually guaranteeing an invitation to apply
- Each province has its own streams and requirements for nomination

### How Express Entry Works

The Express Entry process follows these steps:

1. **Create a profile and enter the pool**
   - Candidates submit an online profile with details about their skills, work experience, language ability, education, and other information
   - Eligible candidates are placed in the Express Entry pool

2. **Receive an invitation to apply (ITA)**
   - Candidates in the pool are ranked using the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS)
   - The highest-ranking candidates are invited to apply for permanent residence through regular draws
   - Different types of draws include general draws, program-specific draws, and category-based draws

3. **Submit an application for permanent residence**
   - Candidates who receive an ITA have 60 days to submit a complete application
   - Applications include supporting documents and payment of fees

4. **Application processing and decision**
   - IRCC processes applications and makes a decision
   - If approved, candidates become permanent residents of Canada

### Types of Express Entry Draws

1. **General Rounds of Invitations**
   - Invites top-ranking candidates eligible for any of the three Express Entry programs

2. **Program-Specific Rounds of Invitations**
   - Invites top-ranking candidates eligible for a specific Express Entry program
   - Examples include draws specifically for the Provincial Nominee Program

3. **Category-Based Rounds of Invitations**
   - Invites candidates based on specific categories established to meet economic goals
   - Examples include draws for candidates with French language proficiency

### Application Fees (as of 2025)

- Principal applicant: $CAN 1,525
- Spouse or common-law partner: $CAN 1,525
- Dependent child: $CAN 260

## National Occupation Classification (NOC)

The NOC is Canada's system for classifying occupations. It categorizes jobs based on Training, Education, Experience, and Responsibilities (TEER):

- TEER 0: Management occupations
- TEER 1: Occupations that usually require a university degree
- TEER 2: Occupations that usually require a college diploma, apprenticeship training, or specialized training
- TEER 3: Occupations that usually require secondary school and/or occupation-specific training
- TEER 4: Occupations that usually require secondary school and/or brief work demonstration or on-the-job training
- TEER 5: Occupations that usually need short work demonstration and no formal education

Express Entry programs generally accept candidates with experience in TEER 0, 1, 2, and 3 categories.
