# Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) Research

## Overview of the CRS

The Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) is a points-based system used by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to assess and score Express Entry profiles. The system ranks candidates in the Express Entry pool based on various factors including:

- Skills
- Education
- Language ability
- Work experience
- Other factors that contribute to economic success in Canada

Candidates with the highest CRS scores are invited to apply for permanent residence through regular draws.

## Implications for Immigration Navigator App

The CRS calculator in our Immigration Navigator app will need to:

1. Accurately calculate scores based on all factors
2. Compare user scores with recent draw trends
3. Identify potential areas for score improvement
4. Suggest optimal immigration pathways based on the user's profile
5. Alert users when new draws occur that match their eligibility
